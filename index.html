#### Before we begin, I would like everyone to know a few things:
1. This ~~assignment~~ project took me longer to work on than I'm happy to admit.
2.  This is <strong>NOT</strong> my best work. I will <em>constantly</em> and <em>consistently</em> improve.
3.  Okay, so maybe I didn't need this third one but here it is, so let's rock.

 <u><p style='text-align: right;'> What's the tea on me? </p> </u>
### <p style='text-align: left;'> here's the long and short of me:
<ul>*  I'm a 24 year old mother of one, a from Norfolk, Virginia.<br/>
  *  My background is primarily customer service.</br>
  *  <strong>HTML</strong>HTML__ was introduced to me by way of __Myspace__.<br/>
  *  I'm a lover of <u>puzzles</u> and problem solving. - which I hope will keep me the most interested in this field.
  *  I'm *not very good* at talking about *myself*.
  *  I do enjoy taking photos of things that I find *interesting*. </p>
</ul>
### <p style='text-align: center;'> I know what you're thinking `yaaaaawwwwnnnnn`</p>
##### and to be quite honest, I can't say I blame you. However, some of the most important people in history have some of the most boring lives leading up to the significant events that have made them memorable, *so just think of this as my origin story* üòâ
