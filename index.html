<em><strong>Before we begin, I would like everyone to know a few things</strong></em>:</br>
<ol>
1. This <strike>assignment</strike> project took me longer to work on than I'm happy to admit.</br>
2.  This is <strong>NOT</strong> my best work. I will <em>constantly</em> and <em>consistently</em> improve.</br>
3.  Okay, so maybe I didn't need this third one but here it is, so let's rock.</ol></br>  
</br> 




 <u><font size=14pt><p style='text-align: right;'> What's the tea on me? </p> </font></u>
<strong><p style='text-align: left;'> here's the long and short of me:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>I'm a 24 year old mother of one, a from Norfolk, Virginia.</li>
  <li>My background is primarily customer service.</li>
  <li><strong>HTML</strong> was introduced to me by way of <B><i>Myspace</B></i>.</li>
  <li>I'm a lover of <u>puzzles</u> and problem solving. <small>- which I hope will keep me the most interested in this field.</small></li>
  <li>I'm <i>not very good</i> at talking about <i>myself</i>.</li>
  <li>I do enjoy taking photos of things that I find <i> Interesting</i>.</li> </p>
</ul>
<p style='text-align: center;'> I know what you're thinking <strong>yaaaaawwwwnnnnn</strong></font></p>
<b>and to be quite honest, I can't say I blame you. However, some of the most important people in history have some of the most boring lives leading up to the significant events that have made them memorable, <em>so just think of this as my origin story</em> üòâ </b>
</br></br>
